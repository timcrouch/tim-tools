## Section 2: Daily Task Acceleration

### The 5 High-Impact Use Cases

#### 1. Email Drafting

**The old way:** Stare at blank screen, write, rewrite, second-guess tone.

**The AI way:** 
```
Prompt: "Draft a professional email to [client name] regarding [topic]. 
Key points to cover: [bullet points]
Tone: [professional but warm / formal / casual]
Length: [brief / detailed]
I want to convey [specific feeling/message]"
```

**Example prompt:**
> Draft an email to Sarah Chen, CEO of TechStart Inc, following up on our proposal presentation last week. Key points: thank her for her time, address her concern about timeline (we can accelerate by 2 weeks if we start before July 1), ask about next steps. Tone: confident but not pushy. Length: 3-4 paragraphs.

**Time savings:** 10-15 minutes per complex email → 2-3 minutes

#### 2. Meeting Summaries

**Before the meeting (preparation):**
```
Prompt: "I have a meeting with [person/company] about [topic]. 
Based on these notes from our last conversation: [paste notes]
Help me prepare by:
1. Summarizing the key open items
2. Suggesting questions I should ask
3. Identifying potential concerns they might raise"
```

**After the meeting (documentation):**
```
Prompt: "Convert these rough meeting notes into a professional summary:
[paste notes]

Format as:
- Attendees
- Key decisions made
- Action items (with owners and deadlines)
- Open questions
- Next steps"
```

**Time savings:** 20-30 minutes → 5 minutes

#### 3. Brainstorming Partner

AI excels as a brainstorming partner because it has no ego and generates ideas quickly.

**Effective brainstorming prompts:**
```
"I'm trying to solve [problem]. Give me 10 different approaches, 
including some unconventional ones."

"Play devil's advocate on this idea: [describe idea]. 
What could go wrong? What am I not considering?"

"We need to differentiate our proposal from competitors. 
Our strengths are [X, Y, Z]. The client values [A, B, C]. 
Suggest 5 ways to position ourselves."
```

**Pro tip for Tim:** *"Use AI to break out of your usual thinking patterns. Ask it to approach problems from different perspectives: 'How would a startup approach this? How would a Fortune 500 company? How would a non-technical person see this?'"*

#### 4. Document Review and Synthesis

**For long documents (contracts, RFPs, technical specs):**
```
Prompt: "Review this [document type] and provide:
1. Executive summary (3-4 sentences)
2. Key terms and conditions that need attention
3. Potential risks or concerns
4. Questions I should ask before signing/responding
5. Comparison to standard industry terms (if applicable)

[Paste document]"
```

**For synthesizing multiple sources:**
```
Prompt: "I have [X] documents about [topic]. Help me synthesize them by:
1. Identifying common themes
2. Noting contradictions or differences
3. Creating a unified summary
4. Highlighting gaps in the information

Document 1: [paste]
Document 2: [paste]
..."
```

**Important note:** For sensitive documents, ensure you're using a platform with appropriate data handling (see Module 7 on Risk and Governance).

#### 5. Research and Analysis

**Quick research compilation:**
```
Prompt: "I need to understand [topic] for a client meeting tomorrow. 
Give me:
1. Key concepts explained simply
2. Current trends and developments
3. Common challenges and solutions
4. Questions to demonstrate knowledge
Keep it focused on what a development firm executive needs to know."
```

**Competitive analysis:**
```
Prompt: "Help me analyze our competitive position for [project type]. 
Our approach: [describe]
Typical alternatives: [list competitors/approaches]
Create a comparison highlighting our differentiators."
```

## Section 3: Building the Habit

### The "AI First" Framework

**Before starting any significant task, ask yourself:**

1. **Could AI draft a first version?** (Writing, emails, documents)
2. **Could AI organize my thoughts?** (Brainstorming, planning)
3. **Could AI summarize or synthesize?** (Reading, research)
4. **Could AI check my work?** (Review, proofreading)
5. **Could AI help me think through this?** (Decision-making, analysis)

### Identifying Opportunities in Your Workflow

**Exercise: The Task Audit**

Have participants list their activities from yesterday:

| Task | Time Spent | AI Could Help? | How? |
|------|-----------|----------------|------|
| Email responses | 45 min | Yes | Draft responses |
| Meeting prep | 30 min | Yes | Research, questions |
| Reading proposal | 20 min | Yes | Summarize key points |
| Status update write-up | 25 min | Yes | Draft from notes |
| Team 1:1 | 30 min | Maybe | Prepare talking points |
| Client call | 45 min | Partial | Prep questions, follow-up |

**Common high-value opportunities:**

1. **Recurring communications** - Weekly updates, status reports, newsletters
2. **First drafts** - Proposals, SOWs, documentation
3. **Meeting preparation** - Agendas, research, talking points
4. **Meeting follow-up** - Summaries, action items, emails
5. **Document review** - Contracts, technical specs, RFPs

### Overcoming Common Barriers

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "It takes too long to explain what I need" | Start with simple tasks. Build a library of prompts that work for you. |
| "The output isn't quite right" | AI output is a draft, not final. 80% done in 20% of the time is still a win. |
| "I forget to use it" | Make AI your default first step. Put the shortcut on your desktop/phone home screen. |
| "I'm worried about confidentiality" | Use appropriate tools for sensitive data (see Module 7). Many tasks use non-sensitive info. |
| "My team doesn't use it" | Start with yourself. Share wins. Let them see the results. |

## Section 4: Advanced Tips

### Prompting Like a Pro

**The CRAFT Framework:**

- **C**ontext: Give background information
- **R**ole: Assign the AI a persona or expertise
- **A**sk: Be specific about what you want
- **F**ormat: Specify the output format
- **T**one: Indicate the communication style

**Example applying CRAFT:**
> **Context:** I run a 50-person software development firm specializing in healthcare applications.
> **Role:** Act as an experienced business development consultant.
> **Ask:** Help me write a response to an RFP for a patient portal system. The RFP emphasizes security and user experience.
> **Format:** Structure the response with clear sections: Executive Summary, Technical Approach, Team Qualifications, Timeline, and Why Choose Us.
> **Tone:** Professional, confident, and focused on outcomes rather than features.

### Building Your Prompt Library

**Encourage participants to save prompts that work:**

Create a simple document or note with your go-to prompts:

```
## My Prompt Library

### Email: Following up after meeting
Draft a follow-up email to [NAME] after our meeting about [TOPIC]. 
Include: [KEY POINTS]. Tone: [TONE]. End with [CALL TO ACTION].

### Document: Meeting summary
Convert these notes into a structured meeting summary...

### Analysis: Quick research
I need to quickly understand [TOPIC] for a meeting. 
Give me the key points an executive needs to know...
```

### Multi-Turn Conversations

**AI conversations build context. Use this to your advantage:**

```
Turn 1: "Help me outline a proposal for a new mobile app project"
Turn 2: "Expand section 2 with more detail on our technical approach"
Turn 3: "Now make the timeline more aggressive - 6 months instead of 9"
Turn 4: "Add a section addressing potential risks and mitigations"
Turn 5: "Convert the key points into an executive summary"
```

## Hands-On Exercise: Complete a Real Task (20 minutes)

### Instructions for Tim to give participants:

**"Open your email inbox or task list. Find a real task you need to do today. We're going to complete it together using AI."**

### Exercise Steps:

1. **Pick your task** (2 minutes)
   - Email you need to write
   - Document you need to review
   - Meeting you need to prepare for
   - Research you need to do

2. **Craft your prompt** (3 minutes)
   - Apply the CRAFT framework
   - Be specific about what you need
   - Include relevant context

3. **Generate and refine** (10 minutes)
   - Submit your prompt
   - Review the output
   - Iterate: "Make it more concise" / "Add more detail about X" / "Change the tone to be more formal"

4. **Finalize** (5 minutes)
   - Make final edits
   - Use the output (send the email, save the document)

### Debrief Questions:
- How long would this task have taken without AI?
- What worked well in your prompt?
- What would you do differently next time?
- Where else could you apply this approach?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement** - It accelerates your work but requires your judgment and expertise

2. **Start simple, build complexity** - Begin with straightforward tasks like email drafting before tackling complex analysis

3. **Quality prompts = quality output** - Invest time in crafting good prompts; save ones that work

4. **Make it habitual** - The biggest productivity gains come from consistent use, not occasional brilliance

5. **80% in 20% of the time** - AI-generated first drafts dramatically reduce time to completion, even if they need editing

---

## Discussion Questions for Tim

Use these to spark conversation and gauge participant engagement:

1. "What task in your day would benefit most from having a first draft instantly available?"

2. "What concerns do you have about using AI for client-related work?"

3. "How do you think your role changes when routine tasks become faster?"

4. "What would you do with an extra hour per day?"

## Facilitator Notes for Tim

### Timing
- Introduction and setup: 10 minutes
- Section 1-2 (Tools and Tasks): 20 minutes
- Section 3 (Building Habits): 10 minutes
- Section 4 (Advanced Tips): 10 minutes
- Hands-on Exercise: 20 minutes
- Debrief and Q&A: 5-10 minutes

### Common Questions to Prepare For

**"Isn't this just going to make us all the same?"**
> No - AI amplifies your expertise and judgment. Two people using AI will get different results based on their prompts, their edits, and their knowledge. It's like saying "doesn't email make everyone's communication the same?"

**"What about accuracy? Can I trust the output?"**
> Always verify important facts. AI is a draft generator, not a fact database. Use it for structure, language, and ideas - but apply your expertise to verify specifics.

**"This seems like cheating."**
> Using a calculator isn't cheating at math. Using spell-check isn't cheating at writing. AI is a tool that lets you focus your human skills on higher-value work.

### Materials Needed
- Participants should have laptops with internet access
- Accounts set up on at least one AI platform (Claude or ChatGPT)
- A real task from their inbox or task list
